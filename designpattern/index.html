			<h1>Book Review</h1>
			<p>I had just finished reading the first four chapters of the book:Head First Design Pattern.  Actually, this is the first book that I had read which discusses software design. I really wished I was introduced to this book at an earlier time. The book is easy to read with the way it is written. It discusses technical knowledge in a conversational way to which a reader would most likely remember it. It contains lot of visuals that make learning more effecient. Another notable thing about the book is that it contains question and some activities making it sort of an interactive learning experience rather than having the platonic bombardment of information for readers. Perhaps, in some way, the book was written in an unformal manner with a less professional theme but regardless of which it did not fail to deliver the goal of the book; the readers to learn, as I had learn so much.</p>
			
			<p>I had limited knowledge with OO design principles and these so called “ Design Patterns”. Honestly, I have no idea about it. I do not have a strong foundation of techincal knowledge with programming and this book is the perfect starting point for me. The book preaches the wisdom and lesson learned by other developer on reoccuring problems that can be solved by design patterns . Each pattern starts of with a problem scenario based on real life where you will be part of a company and you need to make a decision on how you would design a system. There is a step by step approach as to why it would be best used. There might be some degree of knowledge required presequite to reading the book as some terms might be unfamiliar to some reader but it is still forgivable. Google up that unfamiliar term and you’re good to go again.  Sometimes all you need to have is know the term that it is called, and from there you can jump start your learning curve by exploring out on your own.</p>

			Starting of, the book tackled about ‘Strategy Pattern’. The book would then impose you to be part of a company that is working on a duck simulation game. There is a existing design in the system and suddenly the executives wanted to these ducks to be able to fly. The first approached of the narrated developer was just to add fly function then all ducks would just inherit it. But something went wrong as not all ducks should be able to fly. Rubber ducks doens’t fly and then another function of quacking was introduced. This calls to redesign the structure of the system to instead of depending on inheritance, usage of interfaces are introduced. Subsequently after this discussion, the first design principle was introduced by the book. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same. Take what varies and encapsulate it so it won’t affect any other parts of the code adding more flexibility in the system. After doing so, it would follow the second design principle Program to an interface, not an implementation. Part by part, these principles are being integrated into the duck simulation game. I really liked how there would be the logic then it would be converted into a class diagram then it finally be converted into codes, along side with it are comments for beginners to undestand better. Have it in the example below:
